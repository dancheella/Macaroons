The website page has effects implemented on hover over elements, and grid-container have been used for sections displaying benefits and products. Form validation has been implemented for order forms using jQuery and AJAX requests. To complete the booking request, please enter "itlogia" in the Name field. Upon submitting the form, the fields are checked for completion, error messages are displayed, and the form is hidden in case of a successful order placement. Automatic conversion of LESS to CSS has been set up using Gulp.
